 - i need to have a menu page, interactive, record down what people chosen, mobile friendly
 	- with unique id


 - the submit button should goes to an api with all the submitted information

 - need a kitchen client, constant communication with my api requesting information.

 - user
 	- id
 	- name
 	- phone number

 - business
 	- id
 	- name
 	- email
 	- password

 - business has multiple sets of menus
 - i need be to be able to call business.menus
 - menu is a hierarchy that holds no information

 - each menu needs to have the items listed
 	- so each item will have an menu id

 - each items needs to be linked to details
 - so i can call item.details

 - this is just for rendering?

 - each order is a json sent back from the front end to a different API
 	- save it to the db somehow
 		- how does orders table store all the possible details
 		- hstore
 	- the ipad will need to be able to print it
 	- the render needs the table number, items as row
 		- all details listed under as sub bullets

 - on the ipad, how the fuck do i store
 	- the receipt gets printed when the customers are being seated
 	- the server clicks the name, shit gets printed
 	- so info needs to be stored in the server somehow

 - items
 	- id
 	- restaurant_id
 	- name
 	- description
 	- type
 	- picture

 - order, connecting to user and items
 	- id
 	- user_id
 	- items_id
 	- string
